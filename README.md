# BlackJackStrats
This program explores the effectiveness of multiple well know strategies in BlackJack through programing them into java

What it does:
 The first thing that this program offers is a black jack player which is programed to do the basics of blackjack and either
work with a seperate bot that controls the moves or it can be controlled by the user.
This player can either pull from an infinite deck, an autoshuffler of (n) decks, or a hand shuffle of (n) decks. 
Depending on how many decks and what shuffle type probabilities change and thus the strategies of how to play change,
which can be further explored in the strats program.

The Strats program is where the user can begin to see strategies to employ to either increase or decrease their odds of
finishing the game with more money then they started. These strategies come in two variants:
Betting strategies: which variey the bet based off of the previous bets
Playing strategies: which decide when the user should hit(get another card) or stay(keep current cards)

Within the blackjacktester.java you can see an example of how you might test out one of these strategies.
